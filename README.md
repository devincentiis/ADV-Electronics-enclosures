# ADV Parametric Electronics Enclosure made with FreeCAD
Electronics enclosures with parameterized dimensions.
This enclosures serve as a base to most electronic containers I create.
(Designed with FreeCAD 0.21)

## Choice of size
### To choose the dimensions, only change column "B" of the spreadsheet

*Edit the parameters in the FreeCAD spreadsheet to get the correct size.

## Type A (FreeCAD)

### Two "U" plastic elements screwed by 2.2 mm self-tapping screw

## Type B (FreeCAD)

### Two plastic elements screwed by 4 M3 bolts, with or without 16x2 LCD display
The container includes a channel as a seat for a rubber gasket, if you don't have a suitable one and don't need a high level of airtightness you can also use an electrical wire of the right diameter (this is also parameterized).
